His closest friends gathered at London’s Royal Albert Hall to celebrate his life in the only way they knew how – by playing his music. The momentous evening featured George's songs, and music he loved, performed by a lineup that included Clapton, Jools Holland, Jeff Lynne, Paul McCartney, Monty Python, Tom Petty, Billy Preston, Ravi and Anoushka Shankar, Ringo Starr, Dhani Harrison and many more.
 
Directed by David Leland (Wish You Were Here, HBO’s Band Of Brothers and the Traveling Wilburys video “Handle With Care”), the Grammy® Award-winning CONCERT FOR GEORGE captures stunning renditions of some of the most significant music of the 20th century, including “While My Guitar Gently Weeps” (featuring Clapton on guitar, McCartney on piano and Starr on drums), “Taxman” (performed by Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers) and “The Inner Light” (covered by Jeff Lynne and Anoushka Shankar). Lynne, Harrison’s longtime friend and collaborator, produced the audio elements of the concert, while Clapton oversaw the entire proceedings as Musical Director.",,,,,,,,

The band stormed Europe in 1963 and, in 1964, they conquered America. Their groundbreaking world tours changed global youth culture forever and, arguably, invented mass entertainment as we know it today. All the while, the group were composing and recording a series of extraordinarily successful singles and albums. However, the relentless pressure of such unprecedented fame (which in 1966 became uncontrollable turmoil) led to the decision to stop touring. In the ensuing years The Beatles were then free to focus on a series of albums that changed the face of recorded music. Master storyteller and Oscar winner, Ron Howard, explores this incredible journey in his own unique way: How did The Beatles do this? How did they cope with all the fame and pressure? How did they not only survive, but go on to revolutionise popular music? With original interviews, footage, staggering live performances, and the intimate study of character that Ron Howard is known for, he puts us right inside this extraordinary adventure, answering the question everyone always wants to know: What was it like to be there?","In 1962 four young men - John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr - came",,,,,,,

He had a front-row seat as they elevated pop music into an art form, and he was present at the creation of some of the most iconic music of our times.<br /><br />But Asher was also a talented musician in his own right, with a great ear for what was new and fresh. Once, when Paul McCartney wrote a song that John Lennon didn’t think was right for the Beatles, Asher asked if he could record it. “A World Without Love” became a global number-one hit for his duo, Peter and Gordon. A few years later Asher was asked by Paul McCartney to help start Apple Records and the first artist Asher discovered and signed up was a young American singer-songwriter named James Taylor. Before long he would be not only managing and producing Taylor but also (having left Apple and moved to Los Angeles) working with Linda Ronstadt, Neil Diamond, Robin Williams, Joni Mitchell and Cher, among others. <br /><br /><i>In The Beatles from A to Zed</i>, based upon twenty-six episodes of his current and highly popular radio show “From Me to You” on the Beatles Channel of SiriusXM, Peter Asher shares his memories and insights about the Fab Four, weaving his reflections into a whimsical alphabetical journey that focuses not only on songs whose titles start with each letter, but also on recurrent themes in the Beatles’ music, the instruments they played, the innovations they pioneered, the artists who influenced them, the key people in their lives, and the cultural events of the time.",,,,,,

They’ve one hit record (""Love Me Do"") behind them and the next (""Please Please Me"") primed for release, their first album session is booked, and America is clear on the horizon. &#xa0;This is the lesser-known Beatles story—the pre-Fab years of Liverpool and Hamburg—and in many respects the most absorbing and incredible period of them all. Here is the complete and true account of their family lives, childhoods, teenage years and their infatuation with American music, here is the riveting narrative of their unforgettable days and nights in the Cavern Club, their laughs, larks and adventures when they could move about freely, before fame closed in. &#xa0;<br /><br />For those who’ve never read a Beatles book before, this is the place to discover the young men behind the icons. For those who think they know John, Paul, George, and Ringo, it’s time to press the Reset button and tune into the real story, the lasting word.",,,,,,

Womack focuses on the dynamics between John, Paul, George, and Ringo and producer George Martin and his team of engineers, who for the most part set aside the tensions and conflicts that had arisen on previous albums to create a work with an innovative (and among some fans and critics, controversial) studio-bound sound that prominently included the new Moog synthesizer, among other novelties.<br /><br />As Womack shows, <i>Abbey Road</i> was the culmination of the instrumental skills, recording equipment, and artistic vision that the band and George Martin had developed since their early days in the same studio seven years before. A testament to the group’s creativity and their producer’s ingenuity,<i> Solid State </i>is required reading for all fans of the Beatles and the rock ’n’ roll.",© 2020 Blackstone Audio,,,,,

One giant leap for rock ‘n roll.</b><br /><br />NASA’s race with the Russians to land a man on the moon. The meteoric rise of the Beatles, considered by many to have revolutionized the music industry. In the postwar era, each stood as an unprecedented cultural watershed. Together they captured the heady zeitgeist of the 1960s, and ignited the imagination of - just about everyone on the planet.<br /><br /><i>Into the Sky with Diamonds</i> is an exhilarating account of these two global phenomena, as seen through the eyes of Dutch Richtman, a young, enterprising NASA engineer who manages to snag a front row seat to both.<br /><br />Dutch’s memoir takes us on the turbulent ride of breathtaking successes and harrowing failures that marked the early years of space travel - beginning with Projects Mercury and Gemini leading up to the Apollo program. We discover the thrills and sacrifices, personalities and politics involved in navigating these early space missions.&#xa0;<br /><br />And through Dutch’s fictional correspondence with buddy Mal Evans (a character true to the Beatles’ real-life roadie of the same name), we are introduced to a rock band of four working class lads from Liverpool who just happen to turn the music industry on its head and become the unwitting leaders of a youth movement for change. We witness it all: the band’s electrifying rise, their unforgettable debut on the Ed Sullivan show, the social, political, and religious controversies they generated, and their painful dissolution, as John’s fierce attachment to Yoko Ono forever alters the trajectory of the “Fab Four.”<br /><br />Now, in one sweeping 15-hour program, listeners get the highlights of these two cultural phenomena from an expert on all things ‘60s. Those who lived it will be rewarded with insider behind-the-scenes perspective and an abundance of fresh details. Those too young to remember will now never forget the tragedy and triumph that is NASA’s Race to the Moon and the Beatles’ ascent to superstardom.&#xa0;<br /><br />Lending relevancy and poignancy, this timely audio edition of <i>Into the Sky with Diamonds</i> coincides with the 50th anniversary of seminal events related to NASA (e.g. the Apollo 13 mission) and the Beatles (their break up, the release of their final album <i>Let it Be</i> as well as the documentary film of the same name). All the more exciting, the book can provide an entertaining, overarching historical background for Walt Disney’s long-anticipated&#xa0;<i>The Beatles: Get Back</i>, award-winning director Peter Jackson’s reworking of the documentary<i> Let it Be</i>.",© 2020 Ron Grelsamer,,,,,

This was the year the Beatles risked their popularity by retiring from live performances, recording songs that explored alternative states of consciousness, experimenting with avant-garde ideas, and speaking their minds on issues of politics, war, and religion. It was the year their records were burned in America after John's explosive claim that the group was ""more popular than Jesus,"" the year they were hounded out of the Philippines for ""snubbing"" its First Lady, the year John met Yoko Ono, and the year Paul conceived the idea for Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.<br /><br />Music journalist and Beatles expert Steve Turner investigates in detail the enormous changes that took place in the Beatles' lives and work during 1966. He looks at the historical events that had an impact on the group, the music they made that in turn profoundly affected the culture around them, and the vision that allowed four young men from Liverpool to transform popular music and serve as pioneers for artists from Coldplay to David Bowie, Jay-Z to U2.<br /><br />By talking to those close to the group and by drawing on his past interviews with key figures such as George Martin, Timothy Leary, and Ravi Shankar—and the Beatles themselves—Turner gives us the compelling, definitive account of the twelve months that contained everything the Beatles had been and anticipated everything they would still become.",© 2018 Blackstone Audio,,,,,133276.0

It isn’t another exposé about how they broke up. It isn’t a history of their gigs or their gear. It is a collection of essays telling the story of what this ubiquitous band means to a generation who grew up with the Beatles music on their parents’ stereos and their faces on T-shirts. What do the Beatles mean today? Why are they more famous and beloved now than ever? And why do they still matter so much to us, nearly fifty years after they broke up?<br /><br />As he did in his previous books, Love is a Mix Tape, Talking to Girls About Duran Duran, and Turn Around Bright Eyes, Sheffield focuses on the emotional connections we make to music. This time, he focuses on the biggest pop culture phenomenon of all time—The Beatles. In his singular voice, he explores what the Beatles mean today, to fans who have learned to love them on their own terms and not just for the sake of nostalgia. <br /><br />Dreaming the&#xa0;Beatles&#xa0;tells the story of how four lads from Liverpool became the world’s biggest pop group, then broke up—but then somehow just kept getting bigger. At this point, their music doesn’t belong to the past—it belongs to right now. This book is a celebration of that music, showing why the Beatles remain the world’s favorite thing—and how they invented the future we’re all living in today.",,,,,,

This user-friendly reference book will focus on the material they wrote and recorded, and artists who influenced that material. How did The Beatles do it? Musically! That's how. <br /><br />As we all know, many recording artists who followed them were greatly influenced by their body of work. I have gathered annotated quotes, a few by some of the artists who were directly and indirectly influenced by the songs, and the legendary recordings produced by George Martin, Phil Spector, and Chris Thomas (<i>The White Album</i>). <br /><br />I have paid attention to detail in the analysis of when and where certain songs were conceived and taken some liberties in the assumption of certain songs, but have done my best to present solid evidence of the possible influences. The best part of the equation is you. You'll be able to go listen to certain songs by the artists who may have influenced The Beatles, and you'll be able to make final decisions. <br /><br />This is a content-heavy audiobook with a lot of analysis.

George Martin's working-class childhood and musical influences profoundly shaped his early career in the BBC's Classical Music department and as head of the EMI Group's Parlophone Records. Out of them flowed the genius behind his seven years producing the Beatles' incredible body of work, including such albums as <i>Rubber Soul</i>, <i>Revolver</i>, <i>Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band</i>, and <i>Abbey Road</i>.<br /><br />The first book of two, <i>Maximum Volume</i> traces Martin's early years as a scratch pianist, his life in the Fleet Air Arm during the Second World War, and his groundbreaking work as the head of Parlophone Records, when Martin saved the company from ruin after making his name as a producer of comedy recordings. In its most dramatic moments, <i>Maximum Volume</i> narrates the story of Martin's unlikely discovery of the Beatles and his painstaking efforts to prepare their newfangled sound for the British music marketplace. As the story unfolds, Martin and the band craft numerous number-one hits, progressing toward the landmark album <i>Rubber Soul</i>—all of which bear Martin's unmistakable musical signature.",© 2017 Tantor Audio,,,,,

Following the teachings of Maharishi displaced Susan’s devotion to the hippie lifestyle, as she learned about meditation and grew spiritually self aware.<br /><br />Maharishi died in 2008 at the age of 90, but his influence continues throughout the Western World as a result of the spiritual movement he founded: TM (Transcendental Meditation). Other books have been written about the guru, but this is the only one to offer an insider’s view of life and learning in Rishikesh—including the time when the Beatles came to learn at the feet of the Maharishi—as well as behind-the-scene stories of other celebrity disciples. The author lived in the spiritual leader’s ashrams for 22 years, and served on his personal staff for seven of those years.<br /><br />Susan shares: “Merely by being in his presence, we disciples entered an utterly timeless place and rapturous feeling, and, at the same time, realized the utter futility and insanity of the mundane world.”&#xa0;<br /><br />Susan grew from a painfully shy teenage seeker into a spiritually aware teacher and author in her own right. <i>Maharishi &amp; Me</i> is an honest and dynamic exposé about an imperfect person and his dysfunctional organization.",© 2018 Brilliance Audio,,,,,

After seven years as the most popular rock-and-roll group the world has ever seen, the Beatles - torn apart by personal and creative differences - called it quits in 1970, never to play together again. The fact that their contemporaries like the Rolling Stones are still playing today makes their ending even more painful. <br /><br /><i>Once There Was a Way: What if The Beatles Stayed Together?</i> is a story of another reality, the one we wish had happened, where the Fab Four chose to work it out rather than let it be. This book is no mere fairy tale but a chronicle crafted from the people and events of our own history, shaped to create a brand-new narrative in which John, Paul, George, and Ringo find a way to stay friends and keep the band together.

By late 1964, manager Brian Epstein knew that they were not only the biggest act in his stable: they had become the biggest act on earth. America worshipped them. Somewhere different for the start of this tour, in New York - somewhere appropriately massive - had to be found. <br /><br />It was: a baseball stadium in Flushing, Queens. On August 15, 1965, The Beatles played the concert of their lives there. This is that story. Here also are the huge strides in writing, musicianship, and recording the group made in the 12 months or so leading up to Shea Stadium. Some of this was played at the gig but little above the screams was heard. The Beatles at Shea 50 years ago remains, nonetheless, a watershed 1960s moment: the climax in the live career of the greatest quartet the world has known.",© 2016 Audible Studios,,,,,

Along the way, he also gives refreshingly clear descriptions of what music is and how it works: what scales are all about, why some chords sound discordant, and what all postwar pop songs have in common.<br /><br />The story of music is the story of our urge to invent, connect, rebel—and entertain. Howard Goodall’s beautifully clear and compelling account is both a hymn to human endeavor and a groundbreaking map of our musical journey.",© 2014 Blackstone Audio,,,,,

After John Lennon and George Harrison suddenly left Maharishi's India ashram retreat in 1968, rumors have persisted that the spiritual leader made advances toward young women which overstepped the boundaries expected of a celibate Hindu monk. In disillusionment, Lennon concluded his stay at the ashram by writing ""Sexy Sadie."" He wanted to use Maharishi's name, but changed the title of the song at George Harrison's request.<br /><br /><i>Robes of Silk Feet of Clay</i> reveals the true story of a young woman's love affair with the powerful guru. Just out of college, Judith Bourque went to India to become a teacher of Transcendental Meditation (TM). ""I expected to have a deeply profound spiritual experience with a living prophet ... what I got was a decidedly human one!"" Maharishi told her not to tell anyone about their relationship, and she didn't ... not until he died in 2008. Judith first came out of the closet in David Sieveking's <i>David Wants to Fly</i>, a full-length film documenting the German filmmaker's experiences in learning TM. ""After that interview I felt I needed to share the whole story of my relationship with Maharishi in my own way, and finally decided to write my book.""",© 2018 Blackstone Audio,,,,,

Led by a loose collective of young radicals, they introduced new social, sexual and aesthetic perspectives. Operating out of the heart of London, their various activities, from 'The International Times' - a bi-weekly journal that no hipster could be seen without - to the psychedelic nightclub UFO, promoted alternative lifestyles and values, and sparked a social revolution. This film not only traces the history of this underground scene, but also explores its impact on the pre-eminent British group of the era, The Beatles. Although they were well established by the time the movement emerged, Paul McCartney in particular, was closely linked with several of its key players, and through his exposure to cutting edge concepts brought ideas directly from the avant-garde into the mainstream. Featuring many new interviews with key players from the time including; IT editor and long term friend of Paul McCartney, Barry Miles; founder of IT and UFO club organiser, John 'Hoppy' Hopkins; founder of UFO and Pink Floyd producer , Joe Boyd; Soft Machine drummer, Robert Wyatt; drummer from experimental improvisational collective AMM, Eddie Prevost; proprietor of Indica, the counter-cultural gallery, John Dunbar; Underground scenester, vocalist with The Deviants and IT journalist, Mick Farren; plus author of 'Days in the Life: Voices from the English Underground 1961 - 1971', Jonathon Greene; Beatles expert, Chris Ingham and Mojo jounalist Mark Paytress.
